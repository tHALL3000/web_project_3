# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

This projects is a lovely journey from one coast to another. On this journey, I was able to explore the use of Figma for design briefs, creating a responsive layout with media queries and thoughtfull css values. This was also an excellent place to add two more skills: the use of the grid and creating a link overlay that would not dim the text on it.
